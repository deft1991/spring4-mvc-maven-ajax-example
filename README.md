###4. A few words about my impressions
Many thanks for this task. It was very interesting to fulfill it.
Regardless of the results of the check, I really want to receive feedback.
That where as it is possible to improve. In the course of implementation, a lot of ideas appeared, which unfortunately do not have time to pay.
For example, the validation of the purchase / sale transactions themselves. Calculation of funds and the like.
Also testing through the main method.
You can use a database to store and retrieve values.
I added a trade entry to the form. you can create a deal on it and check it.
The validate button checks the test data. But you can uncomment the validation of the input values.
I do not know if I need to, but I checked the mandatory fields.
I will develop this task for myself.
There was a difficulty with the mandatory fields if there is a field style. It is necessary to create a separate bin for such values ​​and validate it.
I had to use a crutch. =)
The answer comes on the web form.

Once again many thanks for this assignment and the time given to me
